# Email updates

This package is used to send transactional emails to users.

## Running locally

You need to do some extra steps to get this to work with pnpm workspaces as noted [here](https://github.com/resendlabs/react-email/issues/881).

```bash
cd .react-email
yarn # pnpm won't work
```

Then to start it you can run:

```bash
yarn dev
```
